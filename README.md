## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ albums/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ album-one/
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ cover.jpg
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ photo-one.jpg
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ album-one.yml
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
|       â””â”€â”€ gallery.astro
|       â””â”€â”€ gallery/
|           â””â”€â”€ [id].astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
|   â””â”€â”€ utils/
|       â””â”€â”€ albums.ts
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

In `src/content/` is where we store our content collections. We have albums with photos and a configuration file for the content collections.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
